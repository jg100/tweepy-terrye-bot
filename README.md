# tweepy-terrye-bot

Simple twitter bot that pulls from collection of random sentences/tweets
to post.

Use the tweepy library to handle any requests and twitter API.

Used some code from realpython.com for starter for basic functions such as retweeting 

Responses to mentions handled using the nltk eliza chat bot to process text and generate a hopefully 
somewhat relevant response.
